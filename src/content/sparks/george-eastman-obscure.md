> “What we do during our working hours determines what we have; what we do in
> our leisure hours determines what we are.”\
> — George Eastman

## ⌬ Preamble

An examination of the life of George Eastman shows a consistent pattern of
methodical arrangement. This impulse to order and systematize was not limited to
his well-known commercial and philanthropic endeavors. It is observable in his
domestic technologies, his evaluation of transportation, his corporate
timekeeping, and the very design of his life.

## ⌬ Observational Fragments

### ⸻ The Residence: An Inventory of Systems

Eastman’s private residence in Rochester was equipped with a series of
integrated systems, including a self-contained electrical generator, a
twenty-one-station internal telephone network, a built-in central vacuuming
apparatus, and a master clock synchronizing all other timepieces on the
property. The entire residence was less a home than a perfectly calibrated
machine for living, designed with the same intolerance for inefficiency he
brought to the factory floor.[^1]

### ⸻ The Automobiles: Assessment of Use-Cases

His ownership of automobiles reflected a methodical assessment of capabilities,
with separate vehicles for routine trips and long-distance travel based on their
power source—electric or steam. Each was designated for a specific purpose,
aligning the machine’s features with the operational requirements of the task.
His garage, therefore, was not a collection of passions but a portfolio of
solutions, each chosen with the detached logic of a purchasing manager.[^2]

### ⸻ The Calendar: A Procedural Reform

In 1928, the Eastman Kodak company altered its method of accounting by adopting
a thirteen-month calendar, a system which standardized every month to a length
of exactly twenty-eight days. The reform served to regularize fiscal comparisons
by eliminating the chaotic variables of the Gregorian calendar. Here, Eastman’s
drive for logistical precision extended beyond the material world, demanding
that time itself conform to the logic of the spreadsheet.[^3]

### ⸻ The Camera: A User Workflow

The first Kodak camera operated on a return-to-manufacturer basis where the user
would mail the entire apparatus to the factory for film processing and
reloading. This procedure removed all complex variables from the hands of the
consumer, ensuring a uniform, predictable result for every roll. He had invented
not just a camera, but a foolproof system of control, in which the
photographer's own fallibility was simply engineered out of the process.[^4]

### ⸻ Pre-Meditated Exit

On 14 March 1932, George Eastman assembled his friends for what appeared to be a
routine dinner, notable only for the formal witnessing of a revised will. Once
the paperwork was finished and the guests had gone, Eastman composed a nine-word
note—“To my friends, my work is done. Why wait?”—and executed his departure with
a revolver. The evening’s events were arranged with the same logistical
precision as his business dealings; in the end, even his exit strategy left
little room for delay, debate, or second opinions.[^5]
