> _A structured protocol for developing ideas through iterative, layered
> synthesis._

---

The Effusion Labs methodology defines a formal process for capturing,
structuring, and synthesizing ideas. Rather than treating knowledge generation
as linear or goal-directed, this system emphasizes **recursion**, **constraint
layering**, and the accretion of partial structure.

This process is not designed for resolution, but for **traceability**. It
preserves ambiguity, surfaces structural friction, and allows branching
exploration. The core mechanism is not a belief state or narrative arc—it is
**developmental density** through iteration and friction.

## ⌬ Methodological Pipeline

Effusion Labs organizes conceptual progression through a three-phase pipeline.
Each phase retains its own affordances and traceable triggers:

- **[Sparks](/sparks/)**: The initial record of a question, observation, or
  aesthetic impulse. Sparks are typically fragmentary and lack mechanistic
  structure, but encode directional curiosity.

- **[Concepts](/concepts/)**: A matured Spark with structure. Concepts isolate
  internal mechanisms, model constraints, or introduce comparative frames. They
  are the primary unit of system modeling.

- **[Projects](/projects/)**: A synthesis node that tests or applies an
  accumulated Concept. Projects manifest through formalization, tool design, or
  aesthetic implementation.

The pipeline is **nonlinear**. A Project may yield new Sparks. A Concept may
bifurcate when divergent modeling directions appear. Iteration is expected, and
reverse transitions are valid. The pipeline is an interaction map—not a linear
funnel.
