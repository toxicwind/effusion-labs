> *A structured protocol for developing ideas through iterative, layered synthesis.*

---

The Effusion Labs methodology defines a formal process for capturing, structuring, and synthesizing ideas. Rather than treating knowledge generation as linear or goal-directed, this system emphasizes **recursion**, **constraint layering**, and the accretion of partial structure.

This process is not designed for resolution, but for **traceability**. It preserves ambiguity, surfaces structural friction, and allows branching exploration. The core mechanism is not a belief state or narrative arc—it is **developmental density** through iteration and friction.

## ⌬ Development Pipeline

All documents, models, and systems within Effusion Labs follow a common pipeline:

- **[↗ [[sparks]] ]**: A Spark is a preliminary unit—an unformed hypothesis, structural anomaly, or unresolvable observation. It is recorded without requiring internal coherence.
- **[↗ [[concepts]] ]**: A Concept arises when multiple Sparks exhibit overlapping constraints. The Concept phase identifies mechanisms, comparative frames, or isolatable dynamics.
- **[↗ [[projects]] ]**: A Project is an applied synthesis. It consolidates multiple Concepts into a system under test. Projects are evaluated not for truth claims, but for **operational density** and **structural articulation**.

This flow is **not linear**. A Project may produce new Sparks; a Concept may fork into incompatible mechanisms. Recursive motion is the system’s intended state.
