## ⌬ Preamble

Effusion Labs operates as a **digital garden** rather than a linear publication stream. The site is
designed to hold partial insight, iterative refinement, and layered cross-reference without forcing
premature closure. Each document acts as a node inside an expanding knowledge graph; none are
expected to exhaust a subject.

Observation is preferred over declaration. Systemic behaviour, tool interaction, and aesthetic
signals are recorded in direct language, leaving interpretation for later synthesis. Ambiguity is
retained when it surfaces unanswered questions or competing explanations.

Within this frame, personal narrative is limited. Biographical details appear only when they clarify
a structural choice or methodological constraint. The authorial presence is that of a diagnostic
operator, not a protagonist.

---

## ⌬ System Definition

Effusion Labs is an internal methodology for managing intellectual artefacts that resist quick
resolution. Every text fragment, diagram, or prototype is stored as part of an unfolding inquiry.
Documents remain in draft form until successive refinements stabilise them. Stability itself is
provisional; revision remains an open affordance.

Each node links to its predecessors through explicit handles, providing traceability for ideas that
evolve across time and context.

## ⌬ Human–LLM Collaboration

Effusion Labs is maintained through an explicit partnership between human author and language model.
The human supplies context, intention, and curatorial judgement; the model supplies transformation,
synthesis, and structured generation. Documents therefore represent a composite viewpoint: human
prompts establish direction, while model outputs provide initial drafts and analytic scaffolding.

Collaboration is documented, not hidden. Where the model influences wording or structure, that fact
is treated as an observable input, subject to the same analytic scrutiny as any other constraint.
The goal is not to erase the boundary between human and model, but to use it as an experimental
surface for studying mixed‑agency knowledge systems.

## ⌬ Design Logic

Text is organised in longform paragraphs to preserve nuance. Compression is avoided when it would
obscure decision paths or strip context necessary for later recombination. Each paragraph exposes
the premises that anchor its claims, enabling downstream audit without additional excavation.

Clarity is achieved through linkage, not summary. A node signals its position inside the wider
document network; readers navigate outward when additional context is required. Uncertainty is
recorded rather than resolved, because unresolved questions constitute structural data.

---

## ⌬ Architectural Commitments

The garden is implemented in plain markdown for portability and version control. YAML front matter
encodes metadata for automated indexing and retrieval. Internal links use stable handles, allowing
references to survive directory changes.

Every node ends with a fork block instead of a conclusion. Forks present live pointers to unresolved
paths, keeping the document in an active state. Revision history remains visible so that reasoning
steps and change decisions can be inspected.

Suppression events—such as refusal logic or policy‑induced truncation—are logged when they occur.
These artefacts are treated as interface signals and become part of the observable dataset.
