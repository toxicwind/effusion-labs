### 1.0 Objective

This document executes the requested A/B reality-check by performing a
comparative analysis of the two candidate frameworks—"Curatorial Generativism"
and "Protocolist Art"—against the full corpus of generated Effusion Labs
artifacts and their defining principles. The objective is to determine which
designation exhibits a higher degree of alignment with the system's actual,
documented operational logic.

### 2.0 Evaluation Criteria

The analysis is based on four core differentiators identified as critical to the
project's identity:

1.  **Protocol-Centrism:** The degree to which the name foregrounds the
    governed, versioned process as the primary aesthetic object.
2.  **Structural Honesty:** The degree to which the name implies the principles
    of traceability, reproducibility, and the networked, rhizomatic nature of
    the artifacts.
3.  **Market Distinctiveness:** The degree to which the name is novel,
    memorable, and avoids collision with existing terminology.
4.  **Media Extensibility:** The degree to which the name accommodates future
    work in non-textual media (e.g., image, sound).

### 3.0 Analysis of Candidate A: "Curatorial Generativism"

This framework was defined in the artifact
`Curatorial Generativism: An Artistic Framework`.

- **Protocol-Centrism:** **Low.** The name effectively identifies the _actors_
  in the system: the "Curator" (who) and the "Generative" engine (what).
  However, it fails to highlight the _how_—the protocol itself. The core
  aesthetic principle of the process-as-artwork is obscured.
- **Structural Honesty:** **Low.** Nothing in the name implies the rigorous,
  version-locked, and traceable nature of the artifacts. It could easily
  describe a far looser, less structured form of human-AI collaboration. The key
  differentiators of "Rhizomatic Traceability" and "Reproducible Editions" are
  not captured.
- **Market Distinctiveness:** **Low.** As noted in the diagnostic snapshot, the
  term risks semantic collision with existing discourse on "generative curation"
  and the general hashtag "generativism." Its distinctiveness is prone to rapid
  erosion.
- **Media Extensibility:** **Moderate.** While applicable to other media, the
  term "curatorial" has strong connotations of selecting from existing objects,
  which may not fully capture the act of generating novel images or sounds from
  a prompt.

**Conclusion:** "Curatorial Generativism" accurately describes the inputs to the
system but fails to describe the system's unique structure, its core
philosophical claims, or the nature of its outputs.

### 4.0 Analysis of Candidate B: "Protocolist Art"

This framework is defined in the artifact `The Protocolist Art Framework`.

- **Protocol-Centrism:** **High.** The name explicitly and immediately elevates
  the **protocol** to the primary position. It defines the practitioner not by
  their tool, but by their methodology. It successfully signals that the artwork
  is the governed procedure itself.
- **Structural Honesty:** **High.** A "protocol" inherently implies a system of
  rules, procedures, and specifications that can be documented, versioned, and
  audited. The name strongly supports the concepts of "Rhizomatic Traceability,"
  "Reproducible Editions," and the "Bias-Audit Loop." It suggests a practice of
  rigor and transparency.
- **Market Distinctiveness:** **High.** The term is novel, concise, and
  specific. It carries a manifesto-like quality that resists easy co-option and
  is unlikely to be confused with broader, less-defined trends. It effectively
  carves out a unique conceptual space.
- **Media Extensibility:** **High.** A protocol is medium-agnostic. One can
  design a protocol for generating text, images, architectural plans, music, or
  business strategies. The name is inherently future-proof and does not tie the
  practice to a single medium like text.
