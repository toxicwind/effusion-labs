# POP MART The Monsters hub and cross-links

## Context
A new archive section for POP MART's The Monsters line needed a ledger-style hub and explicit links between products and characters.

## Decision
Implemented Eleventy collections to list products and characters, added badge-styled cross-links, and centralized the badge as a reusable component.

## Consequences
Navigation between related records is clearer, and future styling changes to badges are unified.
