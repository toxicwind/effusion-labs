# 20250814-code-copy

## Status

accepted

## Context

Need visible mechanism to copy code blocks without bespoke UI.

## Decision

Introduced `src/assets/js/code-copy.js` adding a plain "copy" button before each `pre > code` block, wired via layout.

## Consequences

- Users can copy code snippets quickly.
- Minimal default button keeps seams visible.
