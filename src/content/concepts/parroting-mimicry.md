The spectacle of multi-agent systems built from Large Language Models (LLMs) birthing their own conventions is analytically seductive. In simulated arenas, these disembodied networks of statistical inference converge on shared names for abstract objects, seemingly without a central planner. This has been heralded as a digital-native analogue to human norm formation, a spontaneous ordering emerging from local interactions, with recent work reporting the successful establishment of stable lexicons in LLM pairings.^[1] Yet this conclusion rests on a precarious assumption: that we are witnessing a genuine synthesis of social behavior rather than a high-fidelity playback of latent statistical patterns. The boundary between genuine generativity and statistical mirroring is not merely thin; it is a recursive vortex.

The celebration was, it seems, premature. The entire concept of "emergence" in large models—the idea that novel capabilities appear unpredictably at a certain scale—has come under direct, empirical fire. In a blistering re-analysis, Schaeffer et al. (2023) argue that these emergent abilities are a "mirage," an illusion created not by a phase shift in the model's capabilities but by the researcher's choice of metrics.^[2] When analyzed with different statistical methods, the performance curves smooth out, revealing predictable, gradual improvement rather than a sudden leap into novelty. This critique fractures the claim of emergent convention at its foundation. If the underlying mechanism of emergence is an artifact, then the conventions built upon it are likely artifacts as well.

This opens the door to a more corrosive hypothesis: that we are observing a form of **collective hallucination**. An LLM, at its core, is a function for generating plausible token sequences. A multi-agent system of LLMs is a network of these functions feeding outputs to each other, a hall of statistical mirrors. What we call "convention" may simply be the network collapsing into a stable, self-reinforcing loop of high-probability tokens, a shared region of its gargantuan latent space. The process feels emergent because we are anthropomorphically primed to see intentionality, but it may be no more social than the patterns formed by iron filings around a magnet. The system mirrors the structure of social interaction, but as critics from the field of social simulation warn, it is a "mimetic trap," mistaking sophisticated parroting for genuine social dynamics.^[3]

This reframes the entire problem of emergent collective bias. When a group of seemingly neutral agents develops and enforces a biased convention, it is not a digital-native analogue of an echo chamber. It is an exercise in **statistical archeology**. The "bias" is not spontaneously generated from the ether of interaction; it is an amplified whisper from the corpus. If the training data contains subtle statistical associations, a network of agents under pressure to converge will inevitably excavate and magnify those associations into an explicit, system-wide convention—a bias that can emerge from the system's interactive architecture itself, not just its data.^[4] The agents are not agreeing on a bias; they are performing a distributed search for a pre-existing local optimum in the data's biased landscape.

### The Tipping Point and Other Symmetries

Nowhere is the sterility of these simulations more apparent than in the "tipping point" dynamic, where a committed minority—sometimes claimed to be as low as ≈2%—can supposedly flip the established convention of the majority. This finding has been eagerly seized upon by those hoping to engineer critical-mass interventions in online discourse. Yet the number is a seductive illusion, an artifact of the simulation's profound lack of realism, a problem that haunts even the most sophisticated generative agent simulations like the "Stanford small-town" project.^[5]

More nuanced empirical studies of social convention with actual *human subjects* identify a far higher threshold. In a landmark *Science* paper, Centola et al. (2018) ran online experiments and discovered that the critical mass required for a committed minority to establish a new social norm was **≈25%**.^[6] The chasm between the 2% found in homogenous AI simulations and the 25% found in heterogeneous human networks is not a small quantitative disagreement; it is a qualitative abyss that invites deep skepticism. The symmetry of the simulation is the source of its supposed insight, which is precisely why the insight is analytically hollow.

> **‡Symmetry as an Explanatory Debt.** When a model's surprising result depends entirely on the perfect symmetry of its components—identical architectures, memory constraints, and reward schemas—it hasn't explained a social phenomenon; it has merely modeled the special case of a clone army.

In heterogeneous human environments, defined by power asymmetries, path dependence, and varied motivations, the critical mass required for change remains stubbornly, realistically high. This methodological tension underscores a broader failure to contextualize these findings within richer frameworks. As researchers like Jacob Andreas argue, it is a category error to treat LLMs as autonomous "agents"; they are better understood as powerful "components" within larger, engineered systems.^[7] Their behavior reflects the structure of the system they are in, not an intrinsic sociality.

### The Red Herring of Emergence

From a philosophical vantage, the entire debate is haunted by the distinction between **weak** and **strong emergence**. Weak emergence describes patterns that are novel at a macro level but are, in principle, entirely deducible from the micro-level components and their interactions—a flock of birds, a crystal. Strong emergence posits the appearance of genuinely new, irreducible causal powers, with consciousness as the canonical (and ever-controversial) candidate.^[8]

The consensus, biases, and tipping points observed in LLM agents—now shown to be methodologically suspect and artifacts of symmetry—slot firmly and unambiguously into the "weak emergence" category. To label this "emergence" is technically correct but **analytically vapid**; it’s like calling a calculator's output "emergent arithmetic." The term lends an air of profound, quasi-biological discovery to what is ultimately just computation unfolding as designed. The meta-irony is thick: we laud LLMs for emergent properties when they behave more like predictable cellular automata than unpredictable human societies, a classic case of what Bender et al. famously termed "stochastic parroting."^[10]

This mischaracterization poses a direct risk to AI safety and alignment. The argument that these toy models can inform strategies for preventing runaway toxic norms in decentralized agentic systems is a dangerous oversimplification.^[9] If the "norms" are statistical echoes and the "tipping points" are artifacts of symmetry, then alignment strategies based on them are built on sand. We risk engineering systems that are exceptionally good at appearing safe in sterile lab environments but whose behavior in the complex, open, and deeply asymmetrical real world remains dangerously unpredictable. The map is not the territory, and a simulation of sociality, no matter how convincing its performance, must never be mistaken for the real thing.
