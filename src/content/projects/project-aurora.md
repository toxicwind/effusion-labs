Project Aurora experiments with interactive cartography that treats knowledge as a landscape. Building on 2025 trends in data-driven design, it renders content clusters as luminous territories that expand as new entries join the garden.

The prototype integrates real-time metadata to plot connections and surface emergent pathways. Users can pan through the map, drill into regions, and watch the terrain shift as the underlying data evolves.
