Project Lichen explores how slow-growing knowledge can be modeled like a living substrate. Inspired by lichen's symbiotic structure, the prototype binds disparate notes into an adaptive graph that thickens where attention accumulates.

Nodes respond to interaction metrics and external data feeds, allowing the garden to reorganize itself as ideas mature. The 2025 design emphasizes subdued palettes and calm motion, creating an aesthetic layer over rigorous data plumbing.
