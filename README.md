# Effusion Labs

Effusion Labs is a Hypebrut-flavoured Eleventy site wired for constrained CI. The build stack couples
Eleventy 3, Vite 7, Tailwind 4, and daisyUI 5 on Node.js ≥ 22.19. Chromium-driven tooling (Puppeteer,
Playwright) now targets a system-installed browser so the pipeline stays deterministic even when the
network is hostile.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev            # Eleventy dev server with Vite
npm run build          # Production build → _site/
npm run lint           # ESLint + Rustywind check + dprint + markdown-link-check
npm run test           # Playwright integration suite (Chromium required)
```

All scripts assume ESM (`"type": "module"`) and respect Node ≥ 22.19. Use `npm run check` to execute
doctor, formatting, linting, and tests as a single gate before shipping.

---

## Script Taxonomy

The npm scripts are grouped by intent. Network-dependent commands are kept under the `tools:*` tree
and guard against restricted CI environments.

### Build & Runtime

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `start` / `dev` | Eleventy dev server with Vite live reload. |
| `build` | Production build wrapper (`build:site`). |
| `build:site` | Runs Eleventy in production mode. |
| `build:offline` | Hydrates the LV Images dataset and runs Eleventy behind the offline shim. |
| `build:ci` | Production build that explicitly keeps `CI_NETWORK_OK=0`. |
| `clean` | Removes the `_site/` output directory. |

### Lint, Format, and Tests

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `format`, `format:check`, `format:classes`, `format:all` | dprint + Rustywind formatting. |
| `lint` | Runs JS lint, Rustywind check, dprint check, and link lint with stage labels. |
| `lint:ci-soft` | Sequential soft-lint bundle used by CI (`npm-run-all` + `|| true`). |
| `lint:classes` | Rustywind `--check` over Eleventy templates. |
| `lint:format` | `dprint check` wrapper for CI-friendly formatting reports. |
| `lint:fix` | ESLint autofix plus link lint (when permitted). |
| `lint:links` | Uses `tools/run-if-network.mjs` to skip when `CI_NETWORK_OK` is not `1`. |
| `lint:dead` | Delegates to `tools:knip:ci`. |
| `test`, `test:watch`, `test:playwright` | Ensure Chromium is wired (`tools/check-chromium.mjs`) before launching the runner. |
| `check` | doctor → format check → **soft** lint → tests. |
| `doctor` | Verifies local prerequisites (`rg`, `fd`, `jq`, `sd`, etc.). |

### Tooling & Datasets

All LV Images routines now flow through `npm run lv-images`. Five opinionated scripts cover the
common paths while still allowing `npm run lv-images -- <command>` for anything advanced:

- `lv-images:refresh` — full Playwright crawl with caching disabled at the browser level.
- `lv-images:sync` — refresh + bundle + verify for a shippable snapshot.
- `lv-images:bundle` — regenerate `lv.bundle.tgz` without touching the crawl.
- `lv-images:build` — hydrate, verify, and run the offline Eleventy build (CI profile).
- `lv-images` — direct access to the pipeline CLI (`npm run lv-images -- stats`, etc.).

- `tools:apply-patches` / `tools:check-patches` — wrap `tools/apply-patches.mjs` for manual patch
  management.
- `tools:run-if-network` — helper used by lint scripts to enforce the network contract.

### MCP Utilities

The MCP gateway lives under `mcp-stack/` and retains the `mcp:*` trio for development, integration,
and smoke testing. They continue to run only when explicitly requested.

---

## Continuous Integration

- **`ci.yml`** — three-stage pipeline (lint → test → build). Lint is marked `continue-on-error` and
  runs `./bin/lint-soft.sh` so failures are logged but never block later stages. Each stage installs
  Chromium via APT and runs `tools/check-chromium.mjs` before any headless work.
  Build artifacts are published as workflow artifacts for inspection.
- **`dead.yml`** — scheduled/manual Knip scan. Respects the network contract and uploads the JSON
  report when generated.
- **`deploy.yml`** — builds the production image with `.portainer/Dockerfile`, pushes to GHCR, and
  optionally pings the Portainer webhook.

> **Network contract:** CI runners treat the public network as unavailable unless
> `CI_NETWORK_OK=1`. Scripts that require outbound traffic are opt-in via `tools/run-if-network.mjs`.

---

## Chromium Policy

- Chromium is provisioned via system packages (`apt-get install chromium`).
- `tools/check-chromium.mjs` validates availability and logs the detected version in CI.
- `bin/chromium` exposes a consistent CLI entrypoint, resolving the system binary via
  `tools/resolve-chromium.mjs` (an existing `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` is honoured when present).
- Puppeteer and Playwright downloads are disabled (`PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=1`,
  `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1`).

This keeps Puppeteer, Playwright, and any Eleventy transforms aligned without hitting forbidden CDNs.

---

## Docker Image

`.portainer/Dockerfile` now targets Debian Bookworm. It installs Chromium inside the build stage,
runs `tools/check-chromium.mjs`, validates patches, and produces the static `_site/` output. The
final image is a slim `nginx:1.27-bookworm` layer with health checks intact.

---

## Shell Shims

Local shims live under `bin/bin/` and provide deterministic CLIs for CI and Docker. Highlights:

- `bin/_lib.sh` removes the repo bin directory from lookup order to avoid recursion.
- `bin/chromium` honours `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` then falls back to the resolver-backed system
  executable.
- `bin/resolve-chromium.sh` surfaces the resolved Chromium path for shell pipelines and CI steps.
- `bin/lint-soft.sh` orchestrates all lint passes, captures non-zero exits, and always returns 0 for
  CI.
- `bin/curl` funnels requests through `tools/shims/curl-to-markdown.mjs` while preserving the system
  binary in `CURL_SHIM_REAL`.
- `fd`, `rg`, and siblings enforce safe defaults (hidden files allowed, repository directories
  excluded, risky flags stripped) before delegating to Node-installed or system binaries.

Shims exit with clear errors when the required command is missing—especially important when running
in CI.
