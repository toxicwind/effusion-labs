# Effusion Labs Knowledge Lab

This is a digital studio and knowledge base for Effusion Labs, built with Eleventy and the powerful `@photogabble/eleventy-plugin-interlinker`.

## Core Technology

-   **Generator**: [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/)
-   **Linking**: All wikilink and backlink functionality is handled by [@photogabble/eleventy-plugin-interlinker](https://github.com/photogabble/eleventy-plugin-interlinker).
-   **Concept Map**: The interactive graph on the `/map/` page is a custom feature. It is generated by `src/_data/conceptMapData.js` and rendered with the `vis.js` library.

    \`\`\`bash
