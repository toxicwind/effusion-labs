# Worklog â€” Canonical Tailwind + DaisyUI Merge

- UTC: 20250906T082826Z
- Actions:
  - Added reusable `src/scripts/theme-utils.js` and rewired `theme-toggle.js`.
  - Consolidated DaisyUI registration to a single `@plugin` in `src/styles/app.tailwind.css`.
  - Added `@source` globs + minimal inline safelist for `dark:prose-invert`.
  - Replaced early theme init with a minimal writer; toggle persists via localStorage.
  - Introduced always-attempt docs snapshotter `tools/docs-snapshot.mjs` and integrated into Eleventy build lifecycle.
  - Added optional `tools/doc-fetcher.mjs` (kept non-fatal), and docs script in `package.json`.
  - Updated README with canonical Tailwind/DaisyUI guidance.
  - Built and verified CSS/assets; smoke-checked representative pages.

## Diffs & Verification Notes

- One Tailwind config at repo root: `tailwind.config.mjs`.
- One CSS entrypoint: `src/styles/app.tailwind.css` (plus overlay CSS).
- One DaisyUI registration (CSS) confirmed by ripgrep across repo.
- No shadow configs detected by `fd`.
- Compiled CSS present at `src/assets/css/app.css`.
