- Activated environment via scripts/llm-bootstrap.sh.
- Investigated broken icons: located icons macro and Eleventy lucide filter.
- Discovered lucide v0.542 exports removed .toSvg map and now use PascalCase icon arrays.
- Implemented SSR renderer filter to build inline SVG from lucide icon arrays.
- Verified build renders SVGs in header (brand, menu, sun/moon) and ext/back links.
- Built site with eleventy; inspected _site/index.html for inline SVG.
- No runtime JS required for icons; theme toggle switches sun/moon visibility.

## Files touched
- lib/eleventy/register.mjs

## Next
- Optional: add unit test for filter mapping (kebabâ†’PascalCase).
