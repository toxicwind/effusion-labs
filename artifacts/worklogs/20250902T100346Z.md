- Activated environment and installed dependencies.
- Investigated product page generation; identified failing products.11ty.js using collections before data loaded.
- Added reusable lineProducts helper to filter archive collections by company, line, and locale.
- Rewrote products.11ty.js to use helper and global data, adding safeguards for empty collections and direct permalink usage.
