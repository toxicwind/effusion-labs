- Added resolveBlend helper to map PixiJS blend mode constants to string fallbacks per v8 docs.
- Updated ring, topo, and starfield rendering to use resolveBlend instead of PIXI.BLEND_MODES.*
- Tests run via node tools/runner.mjs; two overlay style tests failing (mschf-grid missing and seed-based variant).
- Patch snapshot and test log saved.
