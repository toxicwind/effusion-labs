# Worklog â€” Project pages to JSON

- Added `src/_data/projects.json` with structured data for `llm-release-watcher` and `patent-intelligence-agent`.
- Created shared layout `src/_includes/layouts/project.njk` that renders hero, highlights, stack, and status directly from JSON using `page.fileSlug`.
- Simplified project pages to minimal front matter pointing to the layout.
- Kept aesthetic polish: ring-only cards, neon at section level only, spacing `gap-6 sm:gap-8`.
