# Worklog — mcp-stack consolidation

- Initialized canonical `mcp-stack` subproject with gateway, servers, sidecars, profiles, docs, scripts, tests.
- Implemented SSE gateway with lazy stdio server spawning, discovery manifest, observability endpoints.
- Added demo stdio server for smoke testing; wired supervisor with backoff and SSE fanout.
- Implemented sidecar resolver for SearXNG and FlareSolverr with ENV→DNS→disabled precedence.
- Added smoke test (`mcp-stack/tests/smoke.mjs`) validating `/servers`, SSE heartbeat, and child lifecycle.
- Verified locally via Node 24; smoke test passes.
