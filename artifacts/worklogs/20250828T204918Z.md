# Worklog â€” url_encode filter fix

- Activated HYPEBRUT environment via scripts/llm-bootstrap.sh.
- Investigated Eleventy error: Nunjucks filter not found: `url_encode` in src/content/resume.njk.
- Located filters registry (lib/eleventy/register.mjs) and default filters module (lib/filters.js).
- Implemented reusable Nunjucks filter `url_encode` using encodeURIComponent.
- Rebuilt site with `npm run build`; verified resume page renders; build completed successfully.
- Persisted artifacts and prepared final report.
