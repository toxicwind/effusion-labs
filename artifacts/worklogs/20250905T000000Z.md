# Worklog â€” Interlinker Fortification & Hotfix

UTC: 2025-09-05T00:00:00Z

Changes
- Added patch sentinel verifier (`tools/verify-patch-applied.mjs`) and wired into Dockerfile + test runner + operator script.
- Added hotfix discovery artifact generator (`tools/interlinker-hotfix-discover.mjs`).
- Extended fuzz tests to cover DOM-like inputs; added omitted-kind behavioral test.
- Added PR summary utility (`tools/unresolved-to-md.mjs`).
- Documented CI thresholds, CLI audit usage, and patch guarantee in README; refreshed AGENTS wikilinks guidance.

Notes
- Patch-package already present; we added an explicit call fallback for CI layers that disable postinstall.
