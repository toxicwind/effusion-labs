# Worklog â€” Resume Neon Unification

- Activated environment (llm-bootstrap).
- Audited global neon styles in `src/styles/app.tailwind.css`.
- Identified duplication of accent/tabrow/title styles inside `src/content/resume.njk`.
- Created reusable macro `src/_includes/components/neon-card.njk` for neon-accented cards.
- Refactored Resume sections (Summary, Highlights, Experience, Projects, Education) to use `neonCard` and global classes.
- Added neon ring to project hero cards on Patent Intelligence Agent and LLM Release Watcher pages.
- Touched `resume-entry.njk` to harmonize row styling for potential reuse.
- Verified references and class names build against existing Tailwind rules.
