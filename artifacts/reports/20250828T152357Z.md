# Report — Fix global hover lighting (links)

## Summary
Eliminated a container-level hover rule (`hover:prose-a:underline`) that underlined every link when any part of the article was hovered. Scoped hover behavior to individual links inside `.prose` content and preserved accessible focus-visible affordances.

## Evidence
- Source removal: `src/_includes/layout.njk` — dropped `hover:prose-a:underline`.
- Scoped CSS added in `src/styles/app.tailwind.css`:
  - `.prose a { text-decoration: none; text-underline-offset: 2px; }`
  - `.prose a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }`
  - `.prose a:focus-visible { text-decoration: underline; outline: none; }`
- Rebuilt CSS (PostCSS) and site (Eleventy). Grep checks show no `article:hover a` or `hover:prose-a` remnants in compiled CSS.

## Notes
- This change addresses the visual "all links light up" behavior and reduces surprise from other incidental hover cascades originating from the typography container.
- External link styling (`.external-link`) remains unchanged and theme-aware.
