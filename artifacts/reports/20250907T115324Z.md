Summary: Implemented hero code-box bleed and floating nudge; preserved grid and ensured min-w-0 on columns.

Changed: src/consulting.njk

Notes:
- hb-overflow-visible allows child overflow beyond card border.
- hb-float sets z-index layering above the border.
- hb-bleed-r applies negative margin to make the code box bleed.
- hb-nudge + lg:hb-nudge provide subtle translate for floating feel.
- Both hero columns explicitly include min-w-0.
