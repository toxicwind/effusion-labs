# Report — Interlinker patched for dynamic archive pages

Summary: Implemented custom wikilink resolvers (series:, character:, product:) that map to Eleventy pages generated from JSON archives; hardened interlinker parser to handle DOM inputs; added tests. All tests pass.

Changes:
- lib/plugins.js — integrate createArchiveResolvers and merge into resolvingFns
- lib/interlinkers/archives-resolvers.mjs — new reusable resolvers with slug-matching against global archive data
- src/test/interlink-archives.md — test content to exercise resolvers
- test/integration/interlinker-archives-resolvers.spec.mjs — integration test with Eleventy build
- node_modules/@photogabble/... — local patch application: to-html.js helper; updated wikilink/html parsers and interlinker to use it

Verification:
- npm test: pass (17 files; 33 tests)
- interlinker unit test (non-string doc): pass
- dynamic resolver integration test: pass with expected hrefs
