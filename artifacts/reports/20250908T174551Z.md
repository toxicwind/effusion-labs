DECISIONS
Strategy Justification: Adopted A2 template composition at S2 scope with N1 macro and N5 aesthetic infusion to meet hero-centric mandate without new assets.
Assumptions: DaisyUI default styling meets contrast and responsive requirements.
Discarded Alternatives: Custom CSS or JS rejected to honor no-bespoke guardrail.
Pivots & Failures: Attempted web.run research; tool produced no output, so proceeded with repository docs.
Rollback: git revert HEAD~1..HEAD restores original consulting template.

CAPABILITY
Name: bullet
Defaults: renders a chevron-prefixed list item
Usage: {{ bullet('Live threat assessment') }}

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
Monochrome surface, code flicker—surgery ready.
