# Report — Layout Regression Fix (Meta Sidebar + MSCHF)

### Summary
Restored the meta sidebar and MSCHF overlay that disappeared after `src/_includes/layout.njk` was simplified on 2025-09-04. Implemented a responsive two-column layout when meta exists, reintroduced the title header gate, and added the missing overlay/theme scripts.

### Key Changes
- Reinstate meta/aside logic with `metaDisable` and `hasMeta` checks.
- Use `date or page.date` to populate the meta Date field robustly.
- Add `<script src="/assets/js/mschf-overlay.js" defer>` to boot the overlay.
- Add `<script src="/assets/js/theme-toggle.js" defer>` so header toggle works.
- Keep header/footer macros and new CSS/theming intact.

### Verification
- Built site with `npm run build`.
- Opened `_site/content/concepts/ghost-engine/index.html` → meta sidebar present.
- Verified overlay and theme scripts linked at document end.

### Risk
Low: conditional aside only activates when meta fields exist; homepage and other pages without meta remain single-column.
