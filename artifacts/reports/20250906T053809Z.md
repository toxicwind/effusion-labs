# Report â€” Now/Uses Removal

The Now and Uses auxiliary pages were removed per request. The resume top bar and footer links were cleaned accordingly. All other features remain unchanged (themes, geometry, subgrid, container queries).

Verification: `npm run build` completed; `_site/now/` and `_site/uses/` are absent. Resume renders with theme radios and print controls intact.
