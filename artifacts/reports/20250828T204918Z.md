# Report â€” Resume build failure resolved

Problem: Eleventy/Nunjucks failed rendering src/content/resume.njk due to missing `url_encode` filter.

Solution: Added a project-level Nunjucks filter `url_encode` in lib/filters.js and registered it via existing filter loader. Rebuilt successfully.

Verification:
- Build: pass (202 files generated)
- Target template: pass (/_site/content/resume/index.html created)
- Encoding correctness: pass (mailto subject and email encoded)

Notes:
- Implemented as a reusable primitive for future templates.
