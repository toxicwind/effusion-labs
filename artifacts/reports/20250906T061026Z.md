# Report — Borderless Rows & 2025 DaisyUI Polish

## Summary
Eliminated rounded, heavy borders and replaced them with a cleaner 2025 aesthetic: flat edges, subtle inner hairlines, and neon rail accents. Spacing is normalized across resume and project pages.

## Key Changes
- CSS: squared `.card` under `assertive-geometry`; added borderless designs for `.hb-minirow` and `.hb-tabrow` with soft inner separators; kept neon rail.
- Macro: `neonCard` now applies consistent paddings and ring-only surface (no border); defaults to intensity `lite`.
- Templates: project and resume sections updated to align with new macro and spacing scale.

## Rationale
- Borders and rounded corners felt dated and heavy. Rings + inner hairlines preserve structure without visual noise, aligning with modern DaisyUI surfaces.

## Visual Liners
- Mini rows now feel like list “chips” embedded in the card, not boxed items.
- Highlights/experience blocks breathe evenly on sm+ breakpoints.

## Follow‑ups (optional)
- If you want badges de-rounded as well, toggle a `.chips-square` helper to square them on resume.
