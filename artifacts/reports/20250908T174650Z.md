- Logged process in artifacts/worklogs/20250908T174650Z.md and persisted final report in artifacts/reports/20250908T174650Z.md.【F:artifacts/worklogs/20250908T174650Z.md†L1-L2】

EDIT CARDS
- Path: src/consulting.njk
  Ops: Compose
  Anchors: console_line(), .hero, .stats, .card, .steps, form
  Before → After: Brochure-style page → dynamic app surface with DaisyUI primitives.
  Micro Example: `<div class="mockup-code [&_pre]:whitespace-pre ...">`
  Impact: Delivers responsive, authoritative consulting interface.
- Path: artifacts/worklogs/20250908T174650Z.md
  Ops: Record
  Anchors: worklog entry
  Before → After: nonexistent → documented session.
  Micro Example: `- Rewrote consulting.njk with DaisyUI components and data-driven loops`
  Impact: Keeps process traceable.
- Path: artifacts/reports/20250908T174650Z.md
  Ops: Record
  Anchors: final report snapshot
  Before → After: nonexistent → persistent final message.
  Micro Example: `HEADER` heading at top of report.
  Impact: Provides audit-ready summary.

DECISIONS
- Strategy Justification: Adopted Template Composition (A2) within Standard scope (S2) to reframe the page with DaisyUI, adding a reusable macro (N1) and refreshed aesthetic (N5).
- Assumptions: Existing CDN URLs and copy remained authoritative; default skin K1 aligns with business theme.
- Discarded Alternatives: Dropped prior bespoke styles in favor of pure DaisyUI to meet mandate.
- Pivots & Failures: Removed an extra worklog file and discarded auto-generated report changes.
- Rollback: Delete new artifact files and restore prior src/consulting.njk.

CAPABILITY
- Name: console_line
  Defaults: Prefixes and colors hero console output based on severity.
  Usage: `{{ console_line(log) }}`

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
Business steel wrapped in soft code glow—precision under a calm surface.
