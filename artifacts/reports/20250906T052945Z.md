# Report — Résumé Site 2025 Assertive Themes

## Overview
This update delivers a static, theme‑tuned résumé with a crisp two‑column layout, steady card rhythm, and three daisyUI themes (business, night, abyss). It adds living pages (/now, /uses) and two case‑study pages. The implementation favors container queries and CSS subgrid to reduce markup and JS, with geometry rules applied consistently.

## Highlights
- Theme radios: business (default), night, abyss; persisted to localStorage; `?theme=` accepted.
- Assertive geometry on `<html>`: radius 0, card borders 2–3px, accent rail +1px, chunkier badges.
- Experience subgrid aligns title, dates, bullets on common tracks.
- Projects grid and chip sizes adapt via container queries at 28rem/56rem.
- New pages: `/now/`, `/uses/`; case studies: Patent Intelligence Agent, LLM Release Watcher.
- WCAG AA mindful borders/contrast; reduced-motion honored for polish transitions.
