# Report â€” Resume Audit & Neon Consistency

## Summary
Applied neon brutalist accents consistently across the resume and project pages by centralizing styling, removing local duplicates, and introducing a reusable `neonCard` macro. The visual system now relies on global `hb-*` utilities defined in `app.tailwind.css` to ensure uniformity.

## Changes
- New macro `components/neon-card.njk` to wrap content in a neon-accented card with optional title/body classes.
- Resume page: removed inline duplicates of `hb-accent`, `hb-tabrow`, `hb-title`, and `hb-minirow` (now using global CSS), and converted major sections to `neonCard`.
- Project pages: added `hb-neon hb-anim` to hero cards for parity with resume treatments.

## Rationale
- Single source of truth for accent and neon styles reduces drift.
- Macro enables repeatable aesthetic without retyping complex class stacks.
- Cards and rows now share the same glow/rail behavior across pages.

## Next Steps (optional)
- Convert Identity card on resume and project highlight cards to `neonCard` for 100% macro adoption.
- If desired, add a site-wide data flag to toggle neon accents (e.g., `src/_data/ui.json: { "neon": true }`) and gate macro classes on it.
