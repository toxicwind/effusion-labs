WHAT CHANGED

- Replaced consulting layout in src/consulting.njk: DaisyUI micro-header, hero, stats, steps, and form. 【F:src/consulting.njk†L201-L210】【F:src/consulting.njk†L215-L227】【F:src/consulting.njk†L245-L256】【F:src/consulting.njk†L268-L280】【F:src/consulting.njk†L286-L305】
- Composed offerCard macro in src/consulting.njk: reusable intervention cards. 【F:src/consulting.njk†L133-L152】
- Structured OfferCatalog JSON-LD in src/consulting.njk: expose services via schema. 【F:src/consulting.njk†L170-L198】
- Recorded execution log in artifacts/worklogs/20250908T174424Z.md: trace decisions. 【F:artifacts/worklogs/20250908T174424Z.md†L1-L6】

EDIT CARDS

- Path: src/consulting.njk
  Ops: [Compose]
  Anchors: offerCard, .stats, .steps
  Before -> After: Brochure layout with bespoke CSS → data-driven DaisyUI screen.
  Micro Example: {{ offerCard(o) }}
  Impact: Landing scales with DATA and matches business theme.
- Path: artifacts/worklogs/20250908T174424Z.md
  Ops: [Record]
  Anchors: worklog bullet
  Before -> After: No task log → timestamped narrative.
  Micro Example: - Ran npm test (hung, terminated after coverage)
  Impact: Provides audit trail for consulting rewrite.
- Path: artifacts/reports/20250908T174424Z.md
  Ops: [Record]
  Anchors: final report
  Before -> After: Absent report → persisted final message.
  Micro Example: Diff: 3 files changed, 216 insertions(+), 365 deletions(-)
  Impact: Maintains permanent human-readable record.

CHECKS & EVIDENCE

- Name: tests
  Location: npm test

DECISIONS

- Strategy Justification: Opted for template composition (A2) to rebuild a single surface (S2) and introduced a macro for reuse (N1) with restrained brutalist styling (N5).
- Assumptions: Active-voice CTAs and DaisyUI “business” theme meet brief; existing CDNs remain untouched.
- Discarded Alternatives: Custom CSS and partial splits were rejected to honor single-file and utility-only mandates.
- Pivots & Failures: Prettier lacked an .njk parser and test runner required manual termination after coverage output.
- Rollback: Revert commit feat: harden consulting surface.

CAPABILITY

- Name: offerCard macro
  Defaults: Renders DaisyUI card with outline CTA when primary is false
  Usage: {{ offerCard(o) }}
