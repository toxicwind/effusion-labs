WHAT CHANGED
- Added fluid heading utilities in src/styles/utilities/layout.css to scale typography across breakpoints. 【F:src/styles/utilities/layout.css†L4-L6】
- Replaced fixed sizes with fluid classes in src/consulting.njk for hero and section headings. 【F:src/consulting.njk†L383-L390】
- Composed hero console container with lg-only float utilities in src/consulting.njk to prevent mobile overflow. 【F:src/consulting.njk†L407】
- Aestheticized hero card padding for tighter mobile spacing in src/consulting.njk. 【F:src/consulting.njk†L383-L390】

EDIT CARDS
Path: src/styles/utilities/layout.css
Ops: [Normalize]
Anchors: .hb-fluid-h1, .hb-fluid-h2, .hb-fluid-kicker
Before → After: No responsive heading utilities → Unified fluid typography helpers.
Micro Example: `.hb-fluid-h1 { @apply text-4xl sm:text-5xl md:text-7xl lg:text-8xl; }`
Impact: Enables consistent mobile scaling for headings across templates.

Path: src/consulting.njk
Ops: [Compose, Aestheticize]
Anchors: hb-fluid-h1, lg:hb-float
Before → After: Overlarge text and always-floating console → Fluid typography and float limited to large screens.
Micro Example: `<div class="... lg:hb-float lg:hb-bleed-r lg:hb-nudge lg:hb-float-cr">`
Impact: Consulting page reads cleanly on phones without losing hypebrut flair.

Path: artifacts/worklogs/20250907T123838Z.md
Ops: [Document]
Anchors: worklog
Before → After: N/A → Added worklog entry.
Micro Example: `- Added fluid heading utilities in src/styles/utilities/layout.css`
Impact: Provides audit trail.

Path: artifacts/reports/20250907T123838Z.md
Ops: [Document]
Anchors: report
Before → After: N/A → Added final report.
Micro Example: `Summary: Improved consulting page mobile responsiveness...`
Impact: Persists final report.

DECISIONS
Strategy Justification: Used Template Composition (A2) at Standard scope (S2) to refactor page markup and utilities; introduced reusable fluid heading utilities for future pages (N1) while preserving hypebrut aesthetic (N5).
Assumptions: User desired mobile readability without sacrificing visual style; Tailwind's mobile-first approach guides responsive utility design. 【850a71†L2-L4】
Discarded Alternatives: Considered rewriting hero as flex column with separate component, but deemed overkill; avoided adding JS for dynamic resizing.
Pivots & Failures: Initial attempt to toggle hero console float via CSS fallback caused unintended absolute positioning; resolved by gating float utilities behind lg: variants.
Rollback: Revert files `src/styles/utilities/layout.css` and `src/consulting.njk`, then remove worklog/report entries.

CAPABILITY
Name: hb-fluid-h1/h2/kicker utilities
Defaults: Mobile-first heading sizes that scale at sm/md/lg breakpoints.
Usage: `<h1 class="hb-fluid-h1">Title</h1>`

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
Neon rails now collapse gracefully, letting the hero breathe on the smallest glass rectangle.
