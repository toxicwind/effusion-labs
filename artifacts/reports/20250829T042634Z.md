# Report

Fixed Nunjucks parsing error in resume template by replacing inline `set` with ternary operators to block `set` with `{% endset %}` and explicit `{% if %}` conditions. Verified by building the site successfully.

Changed:
- src/content/resume.njk: lines for `pageTitle` and `pageDesc` initialization

Verification:
- `npm run build` completed with no template errors
