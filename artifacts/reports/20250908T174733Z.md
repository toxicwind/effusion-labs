DECISIONS
Strategy Justification: Chose A2 to restructure template via DaisyUI components; Scope S2 kept changes within one page; N1 introduced reusable ctaButton macro.
Assumptions: Existing external fonts and scripts must remain; single-page overhaul acceptable.
Discarded Alternatives: Considered keeping previous hypebrut classes but replaced to meet DaisyUI-first directive.
Pivots & Failures: Prettier lacked njk parser so formatting skipped.
Rollback: git revert 67c31b0 and  current commit to remove page and artifacts.

CAPABILITY
Name: ctaButton
Defaults: Renders a link as primary or outline button
Usage: {{ ctaButton({label:'Act',href:'#',primary:true}) }}

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
Console glow fades into a disciplined grid, hypebrut tempered by business steel.
