WHAT CHANGED
- Composed hero with bleeding mockup console and CTA macro in src/consulting.njk to center the page narrative【F:src/consulting.njk†L90-L109】
- Replaced legacy tiles with data-driven stats and intervention cards using DaisyUI loops【F:src/consulting.njk†L113-L145】
- Embedded ProfessionalService offer catalog as JSON-LD for search visibility【F:src/consulting.njk†L202-L227】

EDIT CARDS
- Path: src/consulting.njk
  Ops: Compose
  Anchors: hero-content, stats, steps
  Before → After: Brochure layout → hero-centric hyperbrüt surface.
  Micro Example: `<ul class="steps steps-vertical lg:steps-horizontal">`【F:src/consulting.njk†L150-L154】
  Impact: Establishes decisive, responsive consulting interface.

CHECKS & EVIDENCE
- Name: tests
  Location: ✅ `npm test`
  Expectation: all tests pass
  Verdict: pass【40e72f†L1-L20】

DECISIONS
- Strategy Justification: Used Template Composition to rebuild page with DaisyUI, small scope but high aesthetic impact.
- Assumptions: Existing fonts and CSS assets remained valid.
- Discarded Alternatives: Kept console static instead of adding animation to honor no-js requirement.
- Pivots & Failures: None.
- Rollback: `git checkout -- src/consulting.njk artifacts/worklogs/20250908T175126Z.md artifacts/reports/20250908T175126Z.md`

CAPABILITY
- Name: cta macro
  Defaults: Renders button with primary or outline style based on data
  Usage: `{{ cta(action) }}`

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
Chrome console bleeds right, stats punch left—consulting never looked so armed.
