EDIT CARDS
— Path: src/consulting.njk
  Ops: [Compose]
  Anchors: .hero, mockup-code, steps
  Before → After: Brochure-style page → focused app-like surface built from DaisyUI components.
  Micro Example: `<div class="mockup-code [&_pre]:whitespace-pre w-fit max-w-[96ch]...">`
  Impact: Delivers responsive hero console and consistent components from phone to 4K.

— Path: artifacts/worklogs/20250908T174658Z.md
  Ops: [Document]
  Anchors: process log
  Before → After: No persistent trail → stepwise record of actions.
  Micro Example: `- Activated environment with scripts/llm-bootstrap.sh.`
  Impact: Enables audit of design and testing decisions.

CHECKS & EVIDENCE
- ✅ `npm test` | ensured unit and integration tests run successfully【ace2e0†L1-L20】
- ✅ `npm run lint:advisory` | confirmed archive namespace lint passes【484ad0†L1-L7】
- ✅ `npm run validate:docs` | verified documentation schema【f51f8b†L1-L7】

DECISIONS
- Strategy Justification: Chose A2 Template Composition at S2 scope to refactor one page, introducing N1 macro and N5 visual polish.
- Assumptions: Existing DATA object provided all copy; DaisyUI business theme already available.
- Discarded Alternatives: Considered keeping custom CSS but dropped to meet no-bespoke rule.
- Pivots & Failures: Initial `ls -R` and stalled `npm test` required correction; reran tests and lint.
- Rollback: `git revert f52e656 dd35a79 c4e5286 a5a5225 a82924b6` restores prior consulting template.

CAPABILITY
- Name: chevronList
- Defaults: Renders a bullet list with inline chevron icons.
- Usage: `{{ chevronList(o.features) }}`

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
Cold surface, sharp console—every line a scalpel.
