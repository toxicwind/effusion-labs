## Report — JSONL Raw View Fix

Change: Expose `src/content/archives/**` as passthrough static at `/content/archives/**` so raw `.jsonl` files no longer 404 during local dev and in builds.

Key File: `lib/eleventy/register.mjs` — added `addPassthroughCopy({ "src/content/archives": "content/archives" })`.

Verification:

- Build: `npm run build` succeeded.
- File exists: `_site/content/archives/.../provenance/pop-mart--the-monsters--labubu--fall-in-wild--plush-doll--std--40cm--20240712.jsonl` present.
- HTTP check: `curl -I http://localhost:8080/content/archives/.../pop-mart--the-monsters--labubu--fall-in-wild--plush-doll--std--40cm--20240712.jsonl` returned `200`.

Notes:

- Eleventy Dev Server does not emit a `Content-Type` for `.jsonl`; the file still serves and streams fine. If desired, we can add an `onRequest` handler to set `application/x-ndjson; charset=utf-8` for `*.jsonl` in a follow-up.
