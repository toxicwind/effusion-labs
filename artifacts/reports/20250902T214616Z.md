# Report â€” Product Canon & Legacy Mapping

Acceptance snapshot for product canonicalization:
- Canonical pages exist at /archives/product/<slugCanonical>/.
- `<link rel="canonical">` and `og:url` emit correctly.
- `_redirects` contains deep and alias redirects with 308!; deep stubs exist.
- Internal links prefer canonical; advisory report captured.
- Sitemap excludes stubs; only canonical product URLs.
- Computed slugCanonical with Naming Canon; collisions resolved deterministically.
