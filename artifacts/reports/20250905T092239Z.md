Risk: low

WHAT CHANGED
- Added job macro in src/_includes/components/resume-entry.njk: render reusable experience sections.【F:src/_includes/components/resume-entry.njk†L1-L12】
- Composed navless resume layout in src/_includes/layouts/resume.njk: inject meta and theme while omitting navigation.【F:src/_includes/layouts/resume.njk†L14-L33】【F:src/_includes/layouts/resume.njk†L37-L71】
- Added resume page in src/resume.njk: expose Resume at /resume using new layout and macro.【F:src/resume.njk†L1-L18】
- Removed old standalone template in src/content/resume.njk: eliminate duplicate HTML.

EDIT CARDS
- Path: src/_includes/components/resume-entry.njk
  Ops: [Compose]
  Anchors: resumeEntry()
  Before → After: Manual job markup → macro encapsulation.
  Micro Example: `{{ resumeEntry(job) }}`
  Impact: Consistent, reusable experience entries.

- Path: src/_includes/layouts/resume.njk
  Ops: [Compose, Aestheticize]
  Anchors: `<title>`, theme bootstrap
  Before → After: No layout → head with canonical meta and theme script.
  Micro Example: `<title>{{ pageTitle }}</title>`
  Impact: Brings site aesthetics to a navless page.

- Path: src/resume.njk
  Ops: [Compose]
  Anchors: Experience loop
  Before → After: Inline HTML outside build → templated page using macro.
  Micro Example: `{% for job in resume.experience %} {{ resumeEntry(job) }} {% endfor %}`
  Impact: Resume lives at /resume with automatic builds.

- Path: src/content/resume.njk
  Ops: [Remove]
  Anchors: layout: false
  Before → After: 500‑line handcrafted page → file removed.
  Micro Example: `layout: false` → (deleted)
  Impact: Reduces maintenance and duplication.

CHECKS & EVIDENCE
- Name: node -v
  Location: `hype_run -- node -v`
  Expectation: prints Node version
  Verdict: pass `v22.19.0`【a2dee3†L8】

- Name: npm run build
  Location: `hype_run --capture /tmp/build.log -- npm run build`
  Expectation: Eleventy builds site
  Verdict: pass `✅ Eleventy build completed. Generated 245 files.`【07b723†L257-L260】

- Name: npm run lint:advisory
  Location: `hype_run -- npm run lint:advisory`
  Expectation: outputs advisory lint with no findings
  Verdict: pass `Advisory archive namespace lint written to artifacts/reports/archive-namespace-advisory.json (0 findings)`【428fcc†L9-L14】

DECISIONS
- Strategy Justification: Template Composition (A2) kept scope tight (S2) while adding a reusable macro and harmonized theme (N1,N5).
- Assumptions: Existing resume data sufficed; the page should avoid global navigation but maintain site style.
- Discarded Alternatives: Leaving the 500-line standalone page or embedding experience entries inline.
- Pivots & Failures: `npm test` idled out; switched to lint check. Initially committed generated reports, then reverted.
- Rollback: Restore `src/content/resume.njk` and delete `src/resume.njk`, `src/_includes/layouts/resume.njk`, and `src/_includes/components/resume-entry.njk`.

CAPABILITY
- Name: resumeEntry
- Defaults: Outputs a section with role, company, dates, and bullet highlights.
- Usage: `{% from "components/resume-entry.njk" import resumeEntry %} {{ resumeEntry(job) }}`

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
A clean resume slips through the lab, all signal, no chrome.
