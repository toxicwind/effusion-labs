# Report — Archive Dynamics by Default

Primary Outcome: Wikilinks with archive namespaces resolve to canonical dynamic routes by default.

- Integration A1–A3: Verified series/character/product hrefs.
- Governance B1–B2: Verified README & AGENTS canon sections.
- Advisory C1: Emitted non-blocking namespace lint artifact.
- Side Goal D: New minimal stability tests for DOM inputs.

Notes: Missing dataset entries still link to canonical routes; pages may 404 until data lands.
