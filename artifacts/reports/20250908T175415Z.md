- Composed DaisyUI hero with mockup-code console bleed in src/consulting.njk【F:src/consulting.njk†L192-L208】.
- Replaced metrics with DaisyUI stats in src/consulting.njk【F:src/consulting.njk†L212-L223】.
- Aestheticized offers into DaisyUI cards in src/consulting.njk【F:src/consulting.njk†L226-L246】.
- Composed protocol steps and callout in src/consulting.njk【F:src/consulting.njk†L252-L268】.

3) EDIT CARDS
- Path: src/consulting.njk
  Ops: Compose,Aestheticize
  Anchors: codeLine macro, hero, stats, card, steps, form, JSON-LD
  Before → After: Brochure-style page → app-like surface of canonical DaisyUI components
  Micro Example: `<pre data-prefix="⚠" class="text-error font-semibold"><code>[P0 BREACH] Confidential data leaked...</code></pre>`【F:src/consulting.njk†L149-L154】
  Impact: Creates a hero-centric, high-contrast consulting surface driven entirely by DATA.
- Path: artifacts/worklogs/20250908T175415Z.md
  Ops: Document
  Anchors: n/a
  Before → After: none → worklog notes
  Micro Example: `- Ran tests: npm test, lint:advisory, lint:product-links`【F:artifacts/worklogs/20250908T175415Z.md†L2-L7】
  Impact: Provides audit trail of development steps.
- Path: artifacts/reports/20250908T175415Z.md
  Ops: Document
  Anchors: n/a
  Before → After: none → final report
  Micro Example: `Summary: Rebuilt consulting page into a hyper-aesthetic DaisyUI app surface.`【F:artifacts/reports/20250908T175415Z.md†L2】
  Impact: Persists human-readable summary of changes.

4) CHECKS & EVIDENCE
- Name: npm test
  Location: `npm test`
  Expectation: test suite completes
  Verdict: pass【82a84c†L1-L20】
- Name: lint:advisory
  Location: `npm run lint:advisory`
  Expectation: no advisory issues
  Verdict: pass【2cb1bf†L1-L7】
- Name: lint:product-links
  Location: `npm run lint:product-links`
  Expectation: no product link issues
  Verdict: pass【7efddb†L1-L7】

5) DECISIONS
- Strategy Justification: Template composition (A2) reshaped page via DaisyUI parts; scope standard (S2); introduced reusable macro and aesthetic infusion (N1,N5).
- Assumptions: Artifacts allowed despite single-file scope; DaisyUI docs accurately define component anatomy.
- Discarded Alternatives: Retaining custom HB styles—rejected to meet DaisyUI-first mandate.
- Pivots & Failures: `web.run` unavailable, pivoted to direct `curl` doc retrieval.
- Rollback: Restore previous `src/consulting.njk`.

6) CAPABILITY
- Name: `codeLine` macro
- Defaults: Detects line severity and emits mockup-code `<pre>` with semantic prefix.
- Usage: `{% for l in DATA.hero.code %}{{ codeLine(l) }}{% endfor %}`

7) AESTHETIC CAPSULE
Console bleeds neon into the void, every line a scalpel stroke.
