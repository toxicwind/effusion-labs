Web Insights: Tailwind @source directive clarifies explicit file scanning.
Risk: low

WHAT CHANGED
- Added explicit .11ty.js sources in src/styles/app.tailwind.css: capture programmatic templates.【F:src/styles/app.tailwind.css†L1-L20】
- Composed card-hover interaction in src/styles/components/card.css: lift and primary glow on hover.【F:src/styles/components/card.css†L4-L15】
- Applied card-hover class in src/work/index.njk: demo elevated cards on work index.【F:src/work/index.njk†L11-L20】
- Normalized .gitignore for compiled CSS: ensure app.css and overlay tracked.【F:.gitignore†L41-L45】
- Built Tailwind output in src/assets/css/app.css: single pipeline artifact.【F:src/assets/css/app.css†L1-L2】

EDIT CARDS
- Path: .gitignore
  Ops: Normalize
  Anchors: src/assets/css/*
  Before → After: ignored compiled CSS entirely → tracked app.css and overlay output.
  Micro Example: `!src/assets/css/app.css`
  Impact: Allows committing compiled CSS as canonical artifact.
- Path: src/styles/app.tailwind.css
  Ops: Normalize
  Anchors: @source
  Before → After: scanned only .njk and scripts → also includes .11ty.js templates.
  Micro Example: `@source "../**/*.njk" "../**/*.11ty.js" "../scripts/**/*.js";`
  Impact: Tailwind build stays lean yet comprehensive.
- Path: src/styles/components/card.css
  Ops: Compose, Aestheticize
  Anchors: .card-hover
  Before → After: static card styling → animated lift with semantic glow.
  Micro Example: `.card-hover:hover { transform: translateY(-0.25rem); box-shadow: 0 8px 24px hsl(var(--p)/0.2); }`
  Impact: Cards respond with subtle motion, showcasing modular design.
- Path: src/work/index.njk
  Ops: Compose
  Anchors: card-hover
  Before → After: plain card link → card enhanced with hover effect.
  Micro Example: `class="card card-hover bg-base-100 border border-base-300"`
  Impact: Work grid now demonstrates reusable interaction.
- Path: src/assets/css/app.css
  Ops: Build
  Anchors: n/a
  Before → After: absent → compiled Tailwind artifact.
  Micro Example: `/*! tailwindcss v4.1.12 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com */`
  Impact: Provides single source-of-truth stylesheet.
- Path: src/assets/css/mschf-overlay.css
  Ops: Build
  Anchors: n/a
  Before → After: absent → compiled overlay stylesheet.
  Micro Example: `/* assets/css/mschf-overlay.css */`
  Impact: Ships overlay styles alongside main CSS.
- Path: artifacts/worklogs/20250906T094034Z.md
  Ops: Document
  Anchors: n/a
  Before → After: none → recorded process notes.
  Micro Example: `- Introduced card-hover microinteraction and prefers-reduced-motion safety.`
  Impact: Preserves development trail.
- Path: artifacts/reports/20250906T094034Z.md
  Ops: Document
  Anchors: n/a
  Before → After: none → captured final report.
  Micro Example: `Summary: Refined Tailwind sources and added reusable card hover lift, committing compiled CSS.`
  Impact: Ensures human-auditable summary.

DECISIONS
- Strategy Justification: Chose A4 to refine Tailwind pipeline configuration and S3 scope to touch CSS, templates, and config; introduced N1 reusable class with N5 aesthetic lift.
- Assumptions: Existing tests may be unstable; compiled CSS must be checked in.
- Discarded Alternatives: Considered adding brand-new component but favored enhancing existing cards for clearer demo.
- Pivots & Failures: Test suite revealed unrelated dynamic archive failures; unable to resolve within scope. `llm_snapshot` auto-committed early, leading to subsequent corrective commits.
- Rollback: Reset to commit b83af8d6.

CAPABILITY
- Name: card-hover
- Defaults: Adds transition and primary-colored lift on hover; respects reduced-motion.
- Usage: `<div class="card card-hover">...</div>`

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
Soft neon halos rise as each card levitates, whispering hypebrüt.
