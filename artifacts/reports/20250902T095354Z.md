WHAT CHANGED
- Added toggle in src/_data/site.json: allow enabling spectral rings per page.【F:src/_data/site.json†L1-L4】
- Composed conditional rendering in src/_includes/layout.njk: hide spectral rings when toggle is false.【F:src/_includes/layout.njk†L143-L159】

EDIT CARDS
- Path: src/_data/site.json
  Ops: [Normalize]
  Anchors: heroBandRings
  Before → After: No toggle for rings → global heroBandRings flag defaulting off.
  Micro Example: "heroBandRings": false
  Impact: Exposes site-wide switch to re-enable spectral rings when desired.
- Path: src/_includes/layout.njk
  Ops: [Compose]
  Anchors: showHeroRings
  Before → After: Rings rendered unconditionally → rings gated behind heroBandRings.
  Micro Example: "{% if showHeroRings %}"
  Impact: Removes static center rings while preserving crosshair overlay.

DECISIONS
Strategy Justification: Template tweak with optional switch suited A2 and S2 scope; N2 achieved via heroBandRings toggle.
Assumptions: Removing rings improves clarity while crosshair remains; pages may later re-enable rings via toggle.
Discarded Alternatives: Hard deletion of SVG group—lacked reusability.
Pivots & Failures: Initial test run revealed Nunjucks error; corrected set syntax.
Rollback: Revert src/_data/site.json and src/_includes/layout.njk to previous commit.

CAPABILITY
Name: heroBandRings toggle
Defaults: false
Usage: set page.heroBandRings = true to show spectral rings.

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
SVG once spun halo—now a clean crosshair slices the page.
