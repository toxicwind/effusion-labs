Commit: docs: snapshot Tailwind and daisyUI references
Worklog: artifacts/worklogs/20250906T083936Z.md

Web Insights: Locked in vendor docs for deterministic theming.
Risk: low

WHAT CHANGED
- Added workflow notes in DEVNOTES.md: clarify Tailwind entry, theme edits, and toggle persistence【F:DEVNOTES.md†L1-L7】.
- Snapshot components/install/base/v5/upgrade pages in docs/vendor/daisyui to freeze v5 references【F:docs/vendor/daisyui/README.md†L1-L12】.
- Snapshot detecting-classes/functions-and-directives/upgrade-guide/v4-blog pages in docs/vendor/tailwind to anchor v4 behavior【F:docs/vendor/tailwind/README.md†L1-L11】.
- Extended docs-snapshot.mjs tasks to cover new vendor pages for repeatable fetching【F:tools/docs-snapshot.mjs†L10-L28】.

EDIT CARDS
Path: DEVNOTES.md
Ops: Normalize
Anchors: Tailwind entry
Before → After: No central notes → explicit Tailwind/daisyUI workflow.
Micro Example: `@plugin "daisyui" { themes: ... }`
Impact: Contributors know how to register themes and find docs.

Path: docs/vendor/daisyui/README.md
Ops: Compose
Anchors: Components index
Before → After: Sparse canonical link → enumerated v5 doc URLs.
Micro Example: `- Components index: https://daisyui.com/components/`
Impact: Repository carries pinned references for daisyUI v5.

Path: docs/vendor/daisyui/base.html
Ops: Snapshot
Anchors: `<html>`
Before → After: Missing base docs → stored HTML snapshot.
Micro Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>...`
Impact: Ensures base-layer guidance survives upstream changes.

Path: docs/vendor/daisyui/components.html
Ops: Snapshot
Anchors: `<html>`
Before → After: No components index snapshot → canonical page saved.
Micro Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>...`
Impact: Developers can audit component markup offline.

Path: docs/vendor/daisyui/install.html
Ops: Snapshot
Anchors: `<html>`
Before → After: Install instructions absent → v5 install doc cached.
Micro Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>...`
Impact: Setup steps remain stable regardless of site changes.

Path: docs/vendor/daisyui/upgrade.html
Ops: Snapshot
Anchors: `<html>`
Before → After: No upgrade guidance → v5 upgrade doc stored.
Micro Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>...`
Impact: Migration notes available without web access.

Path: docs/vendor/daisyui/v5.html
Ops: Snapshot
Anchors: `<html>`
Before → After: v5 release notes missing → captured.
Micro Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>...`
Impact: Records rationale behind v5 changes.

Path: docs/vendor/tailwind/README.md
Ops: Compose
Anchors: Detecting classes
Before → After: Single canonical link → enumerated v4 doc URLs.
Micro Example: `- Detecting classes: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files`
Impact: Contributors see authoritative Tailwind v4 references.

Path: docs/vendor/tailwind/detecting-classes.html
Ops: Snapshot
Anchors: `<html>`
Before → After: Page absent → snapshot saved.
Micro Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>...`
Impact: Freezes guidance on v4 class detection.

Path: docs/vendor/tailwind/functions-and-directives.html
Ops: Snapshot
Anchors: `<html>`
Before → After: Missing `@source` docs → page cached.
Micro Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>...`
Impact: Local access to directive semantics.

Path: docs/vendor/tailwind/upgrade-guide.html
Ops: Snapshot
Anchors: `<html>`
Before → After: Upgrade guide not cached → snapshot captured.
Micro Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>...`
Impact: v3→v4 upgrade guidance persists offline.

Path: docs/vendor/tailwind/v4-blog.html
Ops: Snapshot
Anchors: `<html>`
Before → After: Blog absent → static copy stored.
Micro Example: `<!DOCTYPE html>...`
Impact: Historical context for v4 engine is preserved.

Path: tools/docs-snapshot.mjs
Ops: Reusable Primitive
Anchors: TASKS array
Before → After: Fetched few pages and rewrote README → pulls expanded list without README side effects.
Micro Example: `{ vendor: 'tailwind', name: 'upgrade-guide', url: 'https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide' }`
Impact: Single command now snapshots all required vendor docs.

Path: artifacts/worklogs/20250906T083936Z.md
Ops: Compose
Anchors: activation
Before → After: File absent → worklog of actions.
Micro Example: `- Fetching daisyUI docs`
Impact: Maintains traceable history for this change.

Path: artifacts/reports/20250906T083936Z.md
Ops: Compose
Anchors: n/a
Before → After: Report missing → final message persisted.
Micro Example: `Summary: Cached Tailwind v4 and daisyUI v5 docs and noted canonical theme workflow.`
Impact: Human-auditable snapshot of change summary.

CHECKS & EVIDENCE
Name: postcss build
Location: `npx postcss src/styles/app.tailwind.css -o src/assets/css/app.css`
Expectation: Compiles Tailwind+daisyUI into app.css
Verdict: pass【1fea7d†L1-L2】

Name: rg tokens
Location: `/usr/bin/rg -- '\\[data-theme=' src/assets/css/app.css`
Expectation: theme tokens appear once per theme block
Verdict: pass【1e7f83†L1-L20】

Name: npm test
Location: `npm test`
Expectation: test suite executes without failures
Verdict: pass【58c4bf†L1-L20】

DECISIONS
Strategy Justification: Used A4 to reinforce vendor plugin references and N1 by enhancing docs snapshot tooling; S2 kept scope bounded to docs/config.
Assumptions: Existing Tailwind/daisyUI stack was sound; only docs and notes needed consolidation.
Discarded Alternatives: Avoided embedding docs inline in repo history to keep commit small.
Pivots & Failures: Wrapper `rg` and `fd` scripts conflicted; rerouted to system binaries and adjusted PATH.
Rollback: Remove added snapshots, DEVNOTES, and revert docs-snapshot.mjs.

CAPABILITY
Name: snapshotDocs()
Defaults: Fetches and caches extended Tailwind/daisyUI doc set.
Usage: `node tools/docs-snapshot.mjs`

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
Neon lilies and tailwinds, frozen in amber for future flights.
