WHAT CHANGED
- Replaced consulting layout in src/consulting.njk with DaisyUI hero, metrics, interventions, protocol steps, contact form, and footer【F:src/consulting.njk†L169-L259】.
- Added reusable features macro for card bullet lists【F:src/consulting.njk†L111-L117】.

- Path: artifacts/worklogs/20250908T174921Z.md
  Ops: Record
  Anchors: activation
  Before → After: No trace → persistent worklog.
  Micro Example: `- Activated environment with scripts/llm-bootstrap.sh`
  Impact: Documents reasoning for audit.
- Path: artifacts/reports/20250908T174921Z.md
  Ops: Record

DECISIONS
- Strategy Justification: Used Template Composition to rebuild single page with DaisyUI; scope limited to one file; introduced macro for reuse.
- Assumptions: Existing external URLs and theme utilities must remain; DaisyUI components sufficient for layout.
- Discarded Alternatives: Retaining custom hypebrut styles—rejected to meet DaisyUI-only mandate.
- Pivots & Failures: web.run command not available; proceeded with internal knowledge【023476†L1-L7】.
- Rollback: Delete added files and restore src/consulting.njk from git history.

CAPABILITY
- Name: features
- Defaults: Renders list items with chevron icon.
- Usage: `{{ features(o.features) }}`

AESTHETIC CAPSULE
Neon console hums beside the headline—containment poised to deploy.
