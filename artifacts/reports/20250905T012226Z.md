Interlinker Hotfix v3 — Report

Summary: Coerced all Interlinker parser inputs to strings (CJS + ESM), added sentinel comments and `safeMatch(...)`, ensured Docker copies `patches/` before `npm ci`, added CI guard to fail when patches aren’t applied, and introduced safe overrides to quiet deprecation noise.

Web Insights: Not required; change is internal to local plugin usage.
