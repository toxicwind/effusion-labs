# Hero Width Report

## Summary
Hero appeared overly narrow due to a hard cap (max-w-4xl) on the inlay card. It now scales to a much wider, responsive maximum.

## Change
- src/_includes/components/hero.njk: `max-w-4xl` â†’ `max-w-[min(100rem,92vw)]`, plus larger horizontal padding for balance.

## Verification
- `npm run build` completed.
- Verified selector in output HTML contains the new max-w rule.

## Risk
Low: purely presentational class change.
