# Shiki Migration Audit â€“ 2025-08-20

## Summary

- Removed legacy syntax highlighting dependencies.
- Added Shiki stack (`shiki`, `@shikijs/transformers`, `@shikijs/markdown-it`).
- Replaced runtime Lucide icons with inline SVG macros for header navigation.

## Verification

- Repository search shows no references to the old syntax highlighting library.
- Build and tests pass with Shiki-generated code blocks.
