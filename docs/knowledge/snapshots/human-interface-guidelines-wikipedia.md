A page from the [GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME "GNOME") Human Interface Guidelines

**Human interface guidelines** (**HIG**) are [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development "Software development") documents which offer application developers a set of recommendations. Their aim is to improve the experience for the users by making application interfaces more intuitive, learnable, and consistent. Most guides limit themselves to defining a common [look and feel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_and_feel "Look and feel") for applications in a particular [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment "Desktop environment"). The guides enumerate specific policies. Policies are sometimes based on [usability studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_study "Usability study") of [human–computer interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction "Human–computer interaction"), but most reflect the platform developers' preferences. \[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

The central aim of a HIG is to create a consistent experience across the environment (generally an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") or [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment "Desktop environment")), including the [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software") and other tools being used. This means both applying the same visual design and creating consistent access to and behaviour of common elements of the interface – from simple ones such as [buttons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_\(computing\) "Button (computing)") and [icons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_\(computing\) "Icon (computing)") up to more complex constructions, such as [dialog boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_box "Dialog box").

HIGs are recommendations and advice meant to help developers create better applications. Developers sometimes intentionally choose to break them if they think that the guidelines do not fit their application, or [usability testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing "Usability testing") reveals an advantage in doing so. But in turn, the organization publishing the HIG might withhold endorsement of the application. [Mozilla Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox "Mozilla Firefox")'s user interface, for example, goes against the [GNOME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME "GNOME") project's HIG, which is one of the project's main arguments for including [GNOME Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Web "GNOME Web") instead of Firefox in the GNOME distribution.[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

Human interface guidelines often describe the visual design rules, including icon and window design and style. Much less frequently, they specify how user input and [interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction "Human–computer interaction") mechanisms work. Aside from the detailed rules, guidelines sometimes also make broader suggestions about how to organize and design the application and write user-interface text.

HIGs are also done for applications. In this case the HIG will build on a platform HIG by adding the common semantics for a range of application functions.

Cross-platform guidelines
-------------------------

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_interface_guidelines&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Cross-platform guidelines")\]

In contrast to platform-specific guidelines, [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform "Cross-platform") guidelines aren't tied to a distinct platform. These guidelines make recommendations which should be true on any platform. Since this isn't always possible, cross-platform guidelines may weigh the compliance against the imposed work load.
