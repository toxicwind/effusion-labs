# Proxy + Cloudflare Audit Report

## Environment
- Node: v22.18.0
- npm: 11.4.2
- Playwright: Version 1.54.2
- OUTBOUND_PROXY_URL: http://mildlyawesome.com:49159
- http_proxy: http://toxic:Ann3xx!597e5Bmx@mildlyawesome.com:49159
- https_proxy: http://toxic:Ann3xx!597e5Bmx@mildlyawesome.com:49159
- NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS: /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/envoy-mitmproxy-ca-cert.crt

## Dependency Prep
- npm ci executed in root, tools/search2serp, tools/web2md
- npm run build:tools – failed (tools/google-search missing)
- npm run deps:playwright – Chromium downloaded
- npm run deps:system – failed (network unreachable)

## Proxy Preflight
DNS:
172.96.160.178

TCP:
nc: connect to mildlyawesome.com (172.96.160.178) port 49159 (tcp) failed: Network is unreachable

Unauthenticated HTTP:
curl: (7) Failed to connect to mildlyawesome.com port 49159 after 29 ms: Couldn't connect to server
000

Authenticated CONNECT:
curl: (7) Failed to connect to mildlyawesome.com port 49159 after 67 ms: Couldn't connect to server
000

Result: TCP connection to proxy failed; subsequent checks could not proceed.

## E2E Harness
scripts/e2e-serp-proxy-check.sh output:
[Preflight] DNS lookup
172.96.160.178  mildlyawesome.com
[Preflight] TCP connectivity
nc: connect to mildlyawesome.com (172.96.160.178) port 49159 (tcp) failed: Network is unreachable
TCP connection failed
Result: Harness aborted during preflight due to unreachable proxy.

## Code Changes
- Added Playwright dependency scripts and Cloudflare handling utilities.
- Enhanced BrowserEngine with proxy logging, fingerprinting, and persistent state.
- Added Cloudflare detection and retry logic to search2serp and web2md.
- Updated e2e harness to export proxy envs.

## Final Status
FAIL – Proxy server mildlyawesome.com:49159 unreachable (network is unreachable). Search2serp and web2md could not be fully exercised.

### Next Steps
- Verify network path to proxy or try alternative ports (3128/8080).
- Ensure outbound firewall allows access to 172.96.160.178:49159.
